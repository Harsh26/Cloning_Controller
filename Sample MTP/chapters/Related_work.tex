Many researchers are working in domains such as Decentralization, Distributed, and Autonomous Systems. Researchers have developed various MAS platforms. Some of them include JADE\cite{10.1007/978-3-540-85058-8_15} and Aglets\cite{10.1145/295685.295882} written in Java, OSBrain and PADE\cite{pade} written in Python, and Tartarus and Typhon\cite{6524416} written in Prolog.  Apart from that, there are no Python-based MAS platforms that emphasize working with Embedded devices.

\bigbreak
OSBrain\cite{OSBrain} provides the platform to implement a multi-agent and distributed system, but since it is written in Python, it does not have the dynamic code manipulation feature that Prolog has.
\par

\bigbreak
Tartarus Platform provides the decentralization and MAS with dynamic code manipulation, but Python libraries have no support.
\par

\bigbreak
All the works are done either in Java, Python or Prolog, but no platform uses multiple language features. Herein, TarPy does that and gives an edge over other available platforms.
