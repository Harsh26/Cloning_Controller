This report presents TarPy, the Multi Agent Platform developed in python which provides various USPs, it makes CPS work in a decentralised and distributed environment with the agents having on the fly programming feature. The platform uses Tartarus which gives TarPy the feature of dynamic database manipulation, as tartarus is coded in prolog. The platform helps in implementing intelligent algorithms in a distributed manner, thereby CPS can implement concepts of federated learning and much more through TarPy.\par
