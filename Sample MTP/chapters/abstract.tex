In the modern era, Cyber-Physical Systems(CPS) use Embedded devices to control physical processes. By tethering robots as mobile nodes onto this network, it is possible to realize both the flow of information and on-demand physical actuation. These devices behave as autonomous agents directed towards achieving individual goals. Tartarus is one such platform introduced to integrate Cyber-Physical Systems and robots. Tartarus is written in SWI - Prolog, which provides benefits such as the dynamic nature of the code where code can be changed on the fly. However, modern programmers refrain from using Prolog due to other languages that are easier to work with. In this report, we introduce TarPy, a multi-agent platform that acts as the bridge between Tartarus and Python, which tries to coalesce easier syntax of Python with the dynamic nature of Prolog.
